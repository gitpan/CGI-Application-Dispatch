For the full 2.0 release
+ plugin to handle URL creation from dispatch table ( Cees has starter code in CGI::Application::Dispatch::URL)
+ keep parsed rules around in a class structure so it doesn't have to be done every time
+ optional URL cache so that if it sees the same URL more than one, it doesn't even have
    to cycle through the parsed rules, it already knows which one to go to
    (This has been started, but could use refinement, such as limiting the cache
     size to 10,000 entries to possibly avoid some kind of attack).

+ consider improving 404 support. It would nice to: 
    - make the webserver handle this.
    - If we can't pass the job back to the webserver, then
      provide a mechanism for allowing people to set a custom 404 page. 

    - right now a 404 can be returned if an application module doesn't compile. 
      It would be better to return error 500 in this case, and report the name
      of the module with the compile error.
