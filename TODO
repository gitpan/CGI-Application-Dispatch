For the full 2.0 release
+ plugin to handle URL creation from dispatch table
+ keep parsed rules around in a class structure so it doesn't have to be done every time
+ optional URL cache so that if it sees the same URL more than one, it doesn't even have
    to cycle through the parsed rules, it already knows which one to go to
